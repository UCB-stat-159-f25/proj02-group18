=== Prompt 1 ===
How do I verify that MyST is building correctly? I want to check whether the website is rendering before pushing to GitHub Pages.

=== Output 1 ===
The assistant explained how to build and preview the MyST website locally using `jb build` and `jb serve`, and how to check the `_build/html` directory to confirm that the documentation compiled properly before deployment.


=== Prompt 2 ===
How do I set up Binder? Does the environment.yml need to be installed manually or does Binder detect it automatically?

=== Output 2 ===
The assistant clarified the Binder setup requirements, including placing `environment.yml` in the repository root, keeping package versions consistent, and using the Binder badge URL to verify that the environment launches correctly. The assistant also noted that Binder builds can take a long time.


=== Prompt 3 ===
How do I install and activate an environment.yml file? How do I make it work inside Jupyter?

=== Output 3 ===
The assistant explained how to create a conda environment with `conda env create -f environment.yml`, activate it, and register the kernel in Jupyter using `python -m ipykernel install --user --name <env_name>`.


=== Prompt 4 ===
What should go into the README? I’m not sure which sections are required and how Binder and MyST should be documented.

=== Output 4 ===
The assistant provided a recommended README structure, including a project overview, dataset description, installation and execution steps, Binder launch badge, MyST documentation link, and contribution notes.


=== Prompt 5 ===
We worked in parallel and got merge conflicts. How do we resolve the conflict when Git says the merge is not finished?

=== Output 5 ===
The assistant explained how to manually resolve the conflicting lines in the files, stage the edits, and run `git commit` to conclude the merge. The assistant also described how to avoid similar conflicts when collaborating in GitHub.

=== Prompt 6 ===
MyST website is not rendering correctly when clicking pages. I am unsure whether the issue is in myst.yml or _toc.yml. How should these two files be configured?

=== Output 6 ===
The assistant explained that MyST requires both myst.yml and _toc.yml, but they serve different purposes. 
- myst.yml defines the project metadata, authors, theme, site configuration, and points to _toc.yml.
- _toc.yml defines the website structure (root page and chapter ordering).
The assistant confirmed that the configuration was correct and explained how to check website navigation by running `jb build` or `jb serve` locally to preview before deployment.
