# Project 2: Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing

This repository is for Stat 159/259 group 18’s Project 2. The project explores reproducible workflows and modern NLP techniques using the full corpus of U.S. State of the Union speeches (1790–2024). All work is organized into separate notebooks, one per assignment part, and a MyST website that hosts the rendered versions of each notebook.
